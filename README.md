Technical Specifications:
Frontend Technologies:
HTML5: Semantic and accessible markup for structure and navigation.
CSS3: Custom styles with responsive design, soft gradients, and animations using keyframes.
JavaScript (ES6+): Handles real-time calculations, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
Algorithm Logic:
The app uses a robust algorithm to calculate the change due, checking the availability of each denomination in the cash drawer.
It ensures the most efficient use of cash by prioritizing larger denominations first, minimizing the number of coins and bills given as change.
In cases where the exact change is not available, it accurately displays an "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS" message.
